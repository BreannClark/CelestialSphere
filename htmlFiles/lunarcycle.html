            <h4>What is the lunar cycle?</h4>
            The lunar cycle is a period of about 29.5 days in which the moon cycles 
            through all of its phases. Typically, the moon's cycle can be used to 
            keep track of months. The word "month" originates from the word "moon".

            <h4>Why is the lunar cycle important in astrology?</h4>
            In astrology, the lunar cycle is said to be important because each of 
            the phases of the moon has a unique energy that impacts our emotions, 
            intuition, and even our subconscious mind.

        <h3>How the different phases impact moods and behaviors</h3>
        <div style = "display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
            <section>
                <h4>Why does the moon impact our mood?</h4>
                The Moon has certain energetic properties that can be heightened 
                or diminished depending on the phase. The Moon also has a powerful 
                gravitational pull on the Earth that impacts the rising and falling 
                of the tide waters. Human bodies are 72% water so it stands to 
                reason that the gravitational effect of the Moon on the tides 
                applies to us. Humans also have the most complex neurological 
                system of any creature. Nerves work by sending electrical impulses/energy 
                through our bodies, so the Moon's energetic properties 
                can directly impact our nervous system, according to yogi gurus.

                <h4>The New Moon Effects</h4>
                The New Moon is is a time of new beginnings. It's the perfect time 
                to set intentions, goals, or start a new project or habit. The New 
                Moon starts the waxing moon, which is also commonly referred to as 
                the growing moon. When you start something on this moon, you use the 
                Moon's growing energy to help grow your progress. Moods experienced 
                during this time are usually centered around a calmness, and having 
                motivation for the upcoming lunar cycle. This makes it a good time 
                for decision making or learning something new. However, some may 
                feel a drop in energy and desire some quiet time to reset.

            <section>
                <h4>The Waxing Crescent Moon Effects</h4>
                The Waxing Crescent Moon is often associated with feelings of energy,
                ambition, and a positive mindset. It's a time when people may feel 
                motivated to carry out intentions set during the New Moon. This phase
                is also associated with growth, creativity, and developing new ideas. 
                Some interpretations suggest that the ambition associated with this 
                phase may lead to stubbornness or a tendency to be more argumentative. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>The First Quarter Moon Effects</h4>
                The First Quarter Moon is often associated with a boost in mood, 
                motivation, and clarity. However, if progress towards goals or intentions 
                feels slow or stalled, it can lead to feelings of frustration or 
                impatience. Inner conflicts may happen during this phase, making 
                it difficult to make decisions. External pressures may also be amplified, 
                giving rise to feeling under scrutiny or societal expectations. Self 
                care will be important during this moon, especially participating 
                in grounding activities like spending time in nature.

            <section>
                <h4>The Waxing Gibbous Moon Effects</h4>
                The Waxing Gibbous Moon is often associated with increased energy, 
                preparing for the Full Moon's peak energy. It's a time for analyzing 
                your progress and making necessary adjustments to help you in your 
                goals/intentions. This phase may bring challenges or require changes 
                to plans, which will test your patience. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>The Full Moon Effects</h4>
                The Full Moon is the phase of the lunar cycle where the Moon reaches 
                peak luminosity and energy. Everything is heightened during this 
                phase, which is why proper preparation is necessary. The Full Moon 
                does not cause madness, but it will amplify whatever emotions are 
                present. Emotions, sensitivity, and even anxiety may be elevated 
                during this time. Mood wings may be more pronounced, and some might 
                experience sleep disturbances.

                <h4>The Waning Gibbous Moon Effects</h4>
                The Waning Gibbous Moon is a time of shifting from the Moon's energetic 
                peak, to starting to come down in the waning moon, often referred 
                to as the declining moon. This phase is often associated with introspection, 
                release, and gratitude. The declining moon is the perfect time to 
                let go of old habits, negative emotions, or anything that holds you 
                back. Beginning to let go of the old can prepare you for new intentions
                and getting ready fro new goals. Some may find themselves feeling more 
                sensitive during this time. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>The Last Quarter Moon Effects</h4>
                The Last Quarter Moon's waning energy is associated with introspection 
                and reflecting on the previous cycle, paving the way for personal 
                growth. This phase is the best for any cleansing or purifying act 
                (such as taking a detox bath or clearing out old patterns). Some 
                may experience emotional sensitivity as they're confronted with 
                releasing what no longer serves them. The Last Quarter can also 
                bring about shifts in energy, prompting a desire to reorganize and 
                create space for new intentions. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>The Waning Crescent Moon Effects</h4>
                The Waning Crescent Moon is the final phase of the lunar cycle before 
                a New Moon arises. Like the other waning phases, it's associated with 
                introspection and evaluating your progress and growth. It is also 
                beneficial for releasing the old and preparing for new. It's common 
                for people to experience tiredness during this phase, as the Moon's 
                energy is fading. This phase is a time for rest, self care, finding 
                inner peace, and reconnecting with yourself.
