            <strong>What are ruling planets?</strong><br>
            In astrology, a ruling planet is believed to influence your sign's characteristics
            and personality traits. These planets give their governed signs qualities
            that reflect the planet's own nature and expression. Although most governing 
            Celestial bodies are planets, the Sun and the Moon also rule zodiacs.

                        The Sun rules over Leo. Symbolizing vitality, strength, and 
                        the ability to shine, it represents a person's core identity, 
                        ego, and sense of self. The Sun governs a person's personality, 
                        sense of self, and natural inclinations, as well as confidence, 
                        ego, and ability to assert yourself and overcome challenges. It
                        also relates to the overall vitality, energy, and overall physical 
                        health. The Sun also rules leadership qualities, and inspires 
                        taking charge and leading with integrity. A strong Sun can 
                        indicate charisma, optimism, and a commanding presence, while 
                        a weak or afflicted Sun can manifest as arrogance, jealousy, 
                        or anger. It's also associated with father figures and mentors.

                        inner self, and how you instinctively react to situations. 
                        The primary association of the Moon is in the emotional landscape, 
                        where it governs your moods, feelings, and and how you process them. 
                        It also represents your private "inner" self. The Moon also governs
                        your gut feelings, intuition, and ability to habitual responses 
                        to situations. It has significance in the capacity to nurture, 
                        your need for emotional security, and how you care for yourself 
                        and others. The Moon is associated with feminine, receptive, 
                        and nurturing aspects of life, and represents mother figures.

                        quick wit, and effective communication. However, a poorly placed 
                        Mercury can lead to restlessness, superficiality,

                        Neptune rules Pisces beside Jupiter. This planet is associated with 
                        dreams, intuitions, insights, and creativity. It rules the subconscious 
                        mind, giving rise to creativity, fantasy, and visionary thinking. 
                        It is also strongly linked to spirituality, intuition, and connection 
                        to something larger than ourselves. Neptune is also associated with 
                        universal love and compassion. It can also create illusions, dissolving 
                        the lines between what's real and imaginary, but also dissolves 
                        boundaries between emotions, creating a sense of interconnectedness. 
                        Neptune is closely linked to the arts and has a large influence in music, 
                        photography, and film. It can also lead to confusion and escapism, 
                        leading many to substance abuse. When Neptune transits, it can 
                        bring periods of heightened intuition, spiritual awakening, and 
                        creative inspiration. However, during transit it can also bring 
                        confusion, disillusionment, or a tendency to idealize.
